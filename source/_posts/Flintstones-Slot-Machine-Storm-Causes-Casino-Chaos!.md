#  Flintstones Slot Machine Storm Causes Casino Chaos!

Casino officials in Atlantic City are still trying to clean up after a massive power outage caused by a storm knocked out electricity to much of the city, including the casino's slot machines.

The storm, which came through the area late Monday night, caused widespread power outages and property damage. Officials say it could take days to restore power to all areas.

In the meantime, the casino is trying to make do with generators, but that's not enough to run all of the machines. So officials are having to manually open and close machines, which is causing huge lines and long wait times.

"It's been a mess," said one official. "We've never seen anything like this."

The outage is also causing problems for hotel guests, who are without air conditioning or working elevators.

Heavy rains on Saturday, October 20, caused a flash flood at the Laughlin River Lodge and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada.
