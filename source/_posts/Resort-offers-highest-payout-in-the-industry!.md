Baccarat is a simple card game that has been enjoyed by nobility and commoners alike for centuries. It is believed to have originated in Italy in the 15th century, and was introduced to France in the 16th century, where it became popular among the country's elite.

Today, baccarat can be found at almost any casino around the world. The game is played with six decks of cards, and the objective is to draw two or three cards totaling nine or less, also known as a "baccarat".
The player's hand totals are pitted against the dealer's hand total, with the player either winning or losing based on the outcome.
