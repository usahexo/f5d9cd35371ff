#  FC Barcelona defeats Getafe with six poker chips

FC Barcelona has today defeated Getafe CF with six poker chips. The victory of the blaugranas was emphatic as they were never really in danger against a rival that never looked capable of causing an upset. Lionel Messi started on the bench, but it mattered little as his teammates easily dispatched the opposition.

Luis Suarez took the lead for Barça in the first minute of the match with a fine header from a Jordi Alba cross. Philippe Coutinho then doubled the lead ten minutes later with a low drive from outside of the box which goalkeeper Vicente Guaita could do nothing about.

The second half was more of the same, as Barça continued to dominate proceedings and create chances at will. Suarez got his second of the game in the 66th minute, and then three minutes later Messi was introduced to much applause from the Camp Nou faithful.

The Argentine maestro needed just eight minutes to score his first goal, firing home after being teed up by Arthur Melo. Coutinho then got his second of the match shortly before full-time to complete the scoring and give Barcelona an important win in their quest for another La Liga title.

Here are four talking points from today’s match:

1) FC Barcelona looked very impressive against Getafe CF, dominating them in every way possible. This was a typical ‘Lionel Messi team’ performance, as they never really looked like losing despite not having their superstar on the pitch from start to finish.

2) Luis Suarez continues his magnificent scoring form this season, bagging two goals today to take his tally to 23 in all competitions. The Uruguayan is looking as lethal as ever and will be crucial if Barcelona are to win any trophies this year.

3) Philippe Coutinho had another excellent game for Barça, scoring two goals and showing off his trademark flair and trickery. He has been in good form recently and looks like he is starting to settle into life at Camp Nou.

4) With Leo Messi getting back among the goals, FC Barcelona look like they have a very strong attacking lineup heading into end-of-season fixtures. The Argentine superstar is still recovering some of his best form after returning from injury, and it is ominous news for all their rivals."

The second chip is for scoring goals. And again, Barcelona are one of the best teams in the world when it comes to finding the back of the net. They have some of the most talented players in the world and know how to use them effectively.

The third chip is for preventing goals. This is another crucial element of any successful team and Barcelona are no exception. They have a strong defence which has helped them win many trophies over the years.

The fourth chip is for creating chances. Again, Barcelona have some of the best players in the world when it comes to creating chances for their teammates. They know how to open up defences and make things happen in front of goal.

The fifth chip is for managing games. This involves things such as substitutions and tactics on the pitch. Often times, it's this final chip which separates the good teams from the great ones. And once again, Barcelona have proven that they're one of the best in this department too.

The sixth and final chip is for luck. Sometimes things just go your way and this seems to be especially true in sport. Barcelona have been lucky on many occasions throughout their history, and this has helped them achieve some amazing successes.
