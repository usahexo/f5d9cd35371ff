The modern casino paris saint-germain as we know it was founded invia a partnership between François André and Lucien Barrière. The new casino was inaugurated on 14 October 1967, and featured a gaming room with 110 slot machines and 30 gaming tables. It also had a restaurant, bar, and nightclub.

The original Casino de Paris was destroyed by fire in 1977, but was rebuilt and reopened two years later. In 2004, the Casino de Paris merged with the Forges les Eaux casino to form the Groupe Lucien Barrière. This group currently operates 23 casinos in France.

# Where is some sort of casino Paris Saint-Germain?

The Parc des Princes could be the home of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. as well as the national rugby team, France XV. The stadium, which is located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, has a current capacity of 48,712 seats after being renovated for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. However, a larger and more modern football stadium is planned within the Parisian city limits and should be ready for the 2020/21 season.

The original idea was to demolish the Parc des Princes and build a new 65,000-seat stadium in its place, but due to public outcry and protests from nearby residents, that plan was scrapped. The new project will now see PSG move to a new venue called Jean Bouin Stadium—named after the French rugby player who died in World War I—which will have a capacity of around 40,000 spectators.

It’s not all bad news for fans of Les Rouge-et-Bleu though, as renovations on the Parc des Princes are set to begin in 2019 and should be completed by 2022. These upgrades will include a brand-new roof, improved seating and facilities, and a brand-new pitch. So even though PSG might not be calling the Parc des Princes home for much longer, at least it will still be standing!
