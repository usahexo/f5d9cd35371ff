#  Tips from the pros: how to beat the odds at gambling

If you want to make money gambling, whether through casino games, sports betting or poker, there are a few key things to remember that the pros know. Here are some tips to help you beat the odds and make a profit:

1. Always gamble with money you can afford to lose. This is the most important rule of all – never gamble with rent money or money you need for food or bills. Gambling should be viewed as entertainment, not as a way to make money.

2. Do your research. Before placing a bet, know as much as you can about the game or sport you’re betting on. There’s no point in risking your hard-earned cash on something you don’t understand.

3. Start small. Don’t go all in on your first bet – start off by betting a small amount and work your way up gradually. This will help minimize your losses if things don’t go your way at first.

4. Use bankroll management techniques. Make sure you always have enough cash set aside to cover your bets, so that you never risk going into debt because of gambling.

5. Quit while you’re ahead. It might be tempting to keep gambling until you win back all the money you lost, but this is a bad idea – more often than not, it leads to losing even more money. Quit while you’re ahead and walk away with whatever profits you’ve made.

6. Don’t chase losses. If you start to lose money, don’t try to win it back by increasing your bets – this is a recipe for disaster! Walk away from the table or betting screen and come back another day when you’re feeling more confident.

#  Warning: new gambling addiction on the rise

As if compulsive gambling wasn't already a problem, a new form of gambling addiction is on the rise, and doctors are worried.

Codependent gambling, also known as 'net compulsives', refers to people who become hooked on online gambling. They can't resist the allure of pathological gambling, even though they know the consequences could be devastating.

The thrill of gambling online can be so addictive that these people will lose sleep, neglect their work and relationships, and even borrow money to continue gambling. Some eventually hit rock bottom and spiral into depression or commit suicide.

There are several reasons why net compulsives are at higher risk of developing an addiction than traditional gamblers. For one thing, online casinos are available 24/7, which makes them more accessible and harder to resist. Additionally, internet games tend to be more interactive and stimulating than traditional casino games, providing an even stronger rush for addicts.

At the moment, there is no specific treatment for codependent gambling beyond general addiction therapy. However, experts are urging loved ones of net compulsives to get help early in order to prevent things from getting worse. If you or someone you know is struggling with online gambling addiction, please seek professional help immediately.
