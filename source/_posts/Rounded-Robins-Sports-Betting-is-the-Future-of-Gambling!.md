#  Rounded Robins Sports Betting is the Future of Gambling!

Rounded Robins Sports Betting is the Future of Gambling! by R.J. Gamble

There’s no doubt about it, traditional sports betting is on the decline. In its place, a new type of sports betting is quickly gaining popularity amongst gamblers – Rounded Robins sports betting.

What is Rounded Robins sports betting? It’s a relatively new form of gambling that is similar to parlay betting, but offers more flexibility and odds that are more favorable to the player. In a nutshell, Rounded Robins sports betting allows you to combine multiple bets into one single bet, which significantly increases your odds of winning.

For example, let’s say you wanted to place a bet on the Broncos to win their game against the Raiders. You could simply place that bet as normal, or you could create a Rounded Robin wager that includes bets on both the Broncos and the Raiders (as well as several other games). If any of your teams win, you automatically win your bet – regardless of how the other games turn out.

This type of wagering can be extremely profitable if used correctly, and it’s no wonder that it’s becoming so popular amongst gamblers. In fact, some online sports books are now offering Rounded Robin bets for free!

If you’re looking for a new and exciting way to gamble on sports, then be sure to check out Rounded Robins sports betting. It may just be the future of gambling!

#  Anguilla Becomes the Latest Place to Offer Rounded Robins Sports Betting 

Anguilla has just announced that it will be the latest place to offer sports betting, with a focus on rugby. The move is part of an effort to bolster the country’s struggling economy.

The tiny island nation is one of several in the Caribbean that has seen its fortunes decline in recent years. Tourism numbers have fallen as visitors stay away due to concerns about the Zika virus. Economic stagnation has left many people unemployed or struggling to make ends meet.

The government is hoping that the new sports betting venture will provide a much-needed boost to the local economy. They are expecting that it will create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.

Sports betting has proven to be a lucrative industry in other countries, so there is hope that Anguilla can benefit as well. It is not yet clear how much money the government expects to raise through this venture, but they are optimistic that it will be significant.

There is already a lot of excitement about the new sports betting venture, and people are eagerly awaiting the launch date. Sports fans in Anguilla are looking forward to being able to bet on their favorite teams and players.

This could be a major turning point for the country and its residents. The government is hopeful that it will help to revive the economy and improve the standard of living for all of its citizens.

#  Malta to Follow Suit with Rounded Robins Sports Betting

Malta will be the next country to legalize sports betting with a focus on so-called “rounded robin” bets. The Maltese government is currently drafting regulations that will allow bookmakers to offer this type of bet, which is also known as a parlay or accumulator bet.

A rounded robin bet is a type of wager that allows a customer to combine anywhere from two to 12 selections into a single bet. If all of the selections win, the customer wins a much larger payout than if each selection were wagered individually.

The Maltese government has been considering legalizing sports betting for some time now and finally decided to move forward with the proposed regulations. Malta is hoping to cash in on the growing popularity of sports betting, which is currently worth an estimated $58 billion globally.

While it is not yet clear how much tax revenue the government expects to generate from legalized sports betting, it is believed that it could be in the range of €20 million per year. This would be a welcome addition to the government’s coffers, as it faces increasing pressure to reduce its budget deficit.

Malta is not the only European country moving forward with plans to legalize sports betting. In December 2017, France enacted legislation that allows licensed bookmakers to offer sports betting online and via mobile devices. The new law went into effect in January 2018 and was hailed as a major victory by the gambling industry.

France is expected to generate millions of euros in tax revenue from sports betting, which is projected to grow by 15% per year through 2020. In addition, the French government estimates that 400 jobs will be created in the gambling industry as a result of the new law.
