#  Spurs announce plans to open sports betting company in Philippines 

In a move that could shake up the Philippines sports betting industry, Spurs Sports and Gaming Corporation announced plans to open its own sports betting company in the country.

According to a statement released by the company, Spurs plans to invest up to PHP1 billion (US$19 million) in the venture, which is expected to create up to 1,000 jobs.

“The Philippines is one of the most populous countries in the world and has a vibrant economy, making it an attractive market for our sports betting business,” said Spurs CEO Pete Budima.

The company said it plans to offer a wide range of betting options, including on local and international sporting events. It also promised “competitive odds” and “a superior user experience”.

While Spurs is not the only company looking to break into the Philippines sports betting market, it does have a significant competitive advantage over rivals. That’s because it has exclusive rights to use the name “Spurs” and associated branding in connection with sports betting in the country.

This marks a major shift for Spurs, which until now has been primarily involved in casino operations. The company currently operates two casinos in the Philippines – one in Manila and one in Cebu City.

#  Tottenham set to enter sports betting market in the Philippines 

Tottenham Hotspur is set to become the latest English Premier League club to enter the sports betting market in the Philippines.

The move comes after new legislation was passed in the Philippines that allows football clubs to own and operate sports betting shops.

Other clubs that have already entered the Philippine sports betting market include Liverpool and Manchester United.

Tottenham is looking to partner with a local company to operate its sports betting shops in the Philippines.

The move is seen as a way for Tottenham to increase revenue, as well as to further connect with fans in the Philippines.

#  Spurs to open subsidiary sports betting company in the Philippines 

The Tottenham Hotspur football club is to open a subsidiary sports betting company in the Philippines. This follows a ruling by the country's Supreme Court that overturned a prohibition on gambling.

The new company, Spurs Sports and Entertainment, will be based in Manila and will offer betting on a range of sports, including football, basketball and rugby. It is expected to be operational by the end of the year.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: "This is an exciting new venture for the club and we are looking forward to working with our partners in the Philippines to bring world-class sports betting to fans in the region."

The news comes as a number of English Premier League clubs move into the Asian gambling market. Manchester City has a joint venture with Japanese gaming company Yokohama Marinos, while Liverpool has partnered with Chinese online gaming firm Roundhill.

#  Spurs to launch new sports betting company in the Philippines 

SAN ANTONIO – The Spurs announced plans to launch a new sports betting company in the Philippines on Wednesday.

"We are excited to launch Spurs Sports and Entertainment in the Philippines," said Spurs owner Peter Holt. "This is a new venture for us, and we are committed to offering a first-class betting experience for our customers."

Spurs Sports and Entertainment is the latest venture for the basketball team, which has been expanding its operations into other areas of the sports world in recent years. In addition to their NBA team, the Spurs also own and operate a minor league baseball team and a soccer team.

The company is expected to open its doors in early 2019.

The company will offer a range of services, including traditional sports betting, casino games and virtual sports. Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said that the new venture would allow the club to build “a lasting relationship with Filipino fans”.
The Philippines is seen as a key market for sports betting, with revenues from the industry expected to reach $6.7 billion by 2020. The country has a population of over 100 million and many of them are avid bettors. The huge potential for growth in the industry has drawn many foreign companies into the market in recent years. In addition to Tottenham Hotspur, major global brands such as William Hill and Ladbrokes have also launched operations in the Philippines in recent months.
