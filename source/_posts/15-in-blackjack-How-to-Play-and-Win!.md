#  15 in blackjack: How to Play and Win!

If you're looking to up your blackjack game and win more often, then you've come to the right place! In this article, we'll teach you how to play blackjack like a pro, as well as some handy tips and tricks to increase your chances of walking away a winner.

First things first: let's learn how to play blackjack. The basic premise is simple – you're dealt two cards and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are worth 10 points each, while other cards are worth their number value. Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what works in your favour.

If you're dealt two cards that add up to 21 (called a "blackjack"), then you automatically win the round! Otherwise, if your total exceeds 21, then you "bust" and lose the round. If your total is equal to or less than 21 than the dealer's total, you win the round.

Now that we know how to play blackjack, let's take a look at some tips and tricks for increasing our chances of winning:

1. Don't forget your odds!

One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is that it's not a guaranteed win – there is always an element of chance involved. However, by understanding the odds and learning how to use them to our advantage, we can tilt the odds in our favour and increase our chances of winning. For example, hitting on 16 against a dealer's 10 gives us around a 30% chance of winning – so make sure you know when it's worth doubling down or splitting your cards!

2. Use basic strategy charts

Basic strategy charts are another handy tool for helping us increase our chances of winning at blackjack. These charts list the best move for any given situation, so make sure you familiarise yourself with them before playing! You can find free basic strategy charts online or in books dedicated to blackjack strategy.

3. Beware of busting!

One of the main reasons why people lose money whilst playing blackjack is because they don't heed this warning: never ever go over 21! Always remember that once your total goes over 21, you automatically bust and lose the round – no matter what the dealer has. So be mindful of your bets and make sure you stay within safe limits.


4. Know when to split pairs
Split pairs can be a great way of boosting your chances of winning at blackjack – but only if done correctly. For example, if you're dealt two eights then splitting them would be unwise as the likelihood of getting two matching cards (16) is quite high. However, splitting pairs such as kings or aces is usually a good move as it increases our chances of getting two matching cards (22). Just make sure that you weigh up all the options before splitting – sometimes it might be wiser to just stick with one card instead!

#  15 in blackjack: What You Need to Know

When playing blackjack, the goal is to come as close to 21 as possible while not exceeding it. In order to achieve this, players must make informed decisions about the cards they are dealt and the actions they take. The following is a guide to understanding blackjack strategy when playing with a 15 in hand.

Since a 15 is close to 21, it can be played in a few ways. One option is to hit, which means requesting another card from the dealer in hope of getting closer to 21. Another option is to stand, which means not taking any more cards and keeping the total at 15. Finally, players can double down on their 15, meaning they will receive one more card but their bet will be doubled.

Players should generally hit if their second card is worth 6 or less and stand if their second card is 7 or more. Between these values, players should use basic strategy for hitting and standing. Doubling down is most beneficial if the player has 11 points total with their first two cards.

With a 15 in hand, there are many strategic decisions that need to be made in order to achieve the best result. Using the information in this guide, players can make informed choices that will give them the best chance of winning at blackjack with a 15.

#  What can you do with 15 in blackjack?

Put it this way: A lot. In fact, there are a lot of ways that 15 can work in your favor when playing blackjack.

One option is to split the 15 into two hands. This gives you more chances to win, and if one of the hands does end up being a bust, you still have a chance with the other hand.

Another option is to take a hit with 15. This can be risky, but if you are lucky and get another card with a value of 10 or higher, then your hand will total 25 - much better than if you had just stuck with the 15.
