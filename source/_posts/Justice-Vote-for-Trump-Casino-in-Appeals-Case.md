#  Justice Vote for Trump Casino in Appeals Case

In a major victory for the Trump Organization, a judge in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has ruled that the company can proceed with its plans to build a casino in the Catskills.

The decision overturned an earlier ruling by a lower court, which had blocked the project on the grounds that it would harm competition in the region.

Judge Jose Cabranes issued the ruling, which was cheered by executives at the Trump Organization. "We are very pleased with the court's decision," said Donald Trump Jr., executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

The casino, which is to be built near Monticello, has been met with strong opposition from local residents and businesses, who argue that it will bring crime and traffic congestion to the area. The Trump Organization has dismissed these concerns, arguing that the casino will create jobs and bring much-needed revenue to the region.

In his ruling, Judge Cabranes said that while there were some potential harms to competition posed by the casino, they were outweighed by its benefits. He also rejected arguments that construction of the casino would violate state law.

#  Jury Rules in Favor of Trump in Casino Case

A state judge in Nevada has ruled in favor of Donald Trump in a civil case involving his former casino company.

Details of the ruling are not yet available, but Trump's attorneys issued a statement saying they are "happy with the verdict."

The case was brought by investors who claimed that Trump and his associates had misled them about the financial prospects of the Atlantic City casino.

Trump had previously testified that he could not remember reading or signing the prospectus that was at the heart of the lawsuit.

#  Trump Triumphs in Appeals Court Battle Over Casino

President Donald Trump scored a victory in court Wednesday when a federal appeals panel ruled that his administration can proceed with plans to open a new casino in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts.

The decision overturned an earlier ruling by a lower court that blocked the project, which is opposed by the neighboring state of Connecticut.

Connecticut officials had argued that the new casino would siphon away business from their own gambling venues and cost the state jobs and revenue.

But in its unanimous ruling, the three-judge appeals panel said that Trumpâ€™s administration had acted within its authority in approving the project.

The decision opens the way for construction of the $950 million casino, which is expected to create 4,000 jobs. It is due to open in 2021.

#  Trump Casino Wins Major Victory in Appeals Case

In a unanimous decision, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled in favor of the Trump Taj Mahal casino in a case over union benefits.

This is a major victory for the casino as well as for Donald Trump, who is its majority owner. The ruling overturns a lower court's decision that would have required the casino to pay $31 million per year in worker benefits.

The union representing the casino's workers had argued that they should be entitled to the same benefits as employees at other casinos in Atlantic City. However, the Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump Taj Mahal was not bound by a previous state arbitration agreement that set those benefits at other casinos.

This decision is likely to be greeted with relief by the casino's management, which has been struggling financially in recent years. The Trump Taj Mahal narrowly avoided bankruptcy in October of last year, and it is currently in the process of being sold to Carl Icahn, another major player in the Atlantic City gambling scene.

Donald Trump released a statement praising the court's decision and attributing it to his "tough stance on labor unions." He vowed that the new ownership would "make things right" for the casino's workers and ensure that they receive "the best possible benefits."

#  Trump Casino Wins Yet Another Court Battle

Trump Casino, the Atlantic City-based casino company chaired by President Donald Trump, won another legal battle this week, as a state appeals court ruled that it can keep its license to operate.

The company had been fighting for years to keep its license, after being accused of various improprieties, including money laundering and ties to organized crime. But the court ruled on Monday that the evidence presented against the company was not enough to revoke its license.

This is just the latest in a long string of legal victories for Trump Casino. The company has faced numerous lawsuits in recent years, but has so far managed to come out on top in every one of them.

Some analysts have attributed Trump Casino's success in court to the fact that its chairman is the President of the United States. Others say that it is simply because the company has better lawyers than its opponents.

But whatever the reason, Trump Casino continues to win in court, and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.
