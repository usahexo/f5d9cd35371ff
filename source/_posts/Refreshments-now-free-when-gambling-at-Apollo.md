#  Refreshments now free when gambling at Apollo

In an effort to increase customer satisfaction and keep players spending, Apollo has announced that all refreshments are now free while gambling.

“We want to make sure our players have the best possible experience while they’re with us, and that includes making sure they don’t go hungry or thirsty. So now, whether you’re playing slots, blackjack or any of our other games, you can help yourself to as much food and drink as you like, without worrying about the cost.”

This new policy is expected to be a big hit with Apollo customers, many of whom have welcomed the move.

“It’s a great idea – I can lose track of time easily enough when I’m gambling, so it’s nice not to have to worry about getting up to order more drinks or snacks. And the food here is really good too, so it’s like getting an extra bonus while I play.”

Others feel that the move could spell trouble for casino staff, who may find themselves overwhelmed by demand for free food and drink.

Nonetheless, Apollo is optimistic that the change will result in happier customers and increased profits.
