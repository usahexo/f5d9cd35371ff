<h1 id="Time-To-Start-Planning-Your-Strategy-Open-Coming-From-Athens-Is-Here"><a href="#Time-To-Start-Planning-Your-Strategy-Open-Coming-From-Athens-Is-Here" class="headerlink" title="Time To Start Planning Your Strategy - Open Coming From Athens Is Here!"></a>Time To Start Planning Your Strategy - Open Coming From Athens Is Here!</h1><p>After a stellar season on the European Tour, culminating in a dominant victory at the Open Championship at Royal Liverpool Golf Club, many are looking to Rory McIlroy to replicate that form and claim back-to-back majors at the US PGA Championship this week.</p>
<p>However, as defending champion and with many of the world’s best golfers in contention, it is by no means a certainty that McIlroy will retain his title. In this article we explore some of the contenders for this year’s US PGA Championship and offer our thoughts on who is most likely to come out on top next weekend.</p>
<p>Rory McIlroy - 5/2 </p>
<p>As mentioned, McIlroy is the current favourite to win the US PGA Championship and it would be hard to back against him given his recent form. His wire-to-wire victory at the Open Championship was impressive and demonstrated his ability to not only compete but dominate under pressure. However, he has also shown himself to be vulnerable in recent tournaments, notably finishing in a tie for 25th place at The Barclays last week. If he can recapture the blistering form he displayed earlier in the season then he will be difficult to beat but if he is off his game then there are plenty of challengers ready to take advantage.</p>
<p>Dustin Johnson - 12/1 </p>
<p>Johnson began his season in excellent form, winning three tournaments in a row early on, but has since cooled off somewhat. Nonetheless, he still possesses one of the game’s most impressive raw skillsets and with a bit more consistency could well make a serious challenge for this year’s US PGA Championship. He showed glimpses of what he is capable of at The Barclays last week where he finished in a tie for fourth place and will be looking to improve on that result next weekend.</p>
<p>Adam Scott - 16/1 </p>
<p>Scott enjoyed an excellent 2013 season which saw him win his first major championship at The Masters Tournament. He has since failed to win another tournament but consistency has never been one of Scott’s strong points so it would be unwise to discount him completely. He comes into this year’s US PGA Championship having narrowly missed out on winning The Barclays last week, finishing in second place behind Johnson. If he can recapture some of the magic from The Masters then he could well be lifting the Wanamaker Trophy next weekend.</p>
<h1 id="Ready-For-The-Next-Big-Thing-Open-Coming-From-Athens-Is-Just-Around-The-Corner"><a href="#Ready-For-The-Next-Big-Thing-Open-Coming-From-Athens-Is-Just-Around-The-Corner" class="headerlink" title="Ready For The Next Big Thing? Open Coming From Athens Is Just Around The Corner"></a>Ready For The Next Big Thing? Open Coming From Athens Is Just Around The Corner</h1><p>It’s only a few weeks before Athens is set to open its newest attraction:<br>Open. The colossal new theme park is promising visitors “the best day of their lives”, with over 40 attractions and rides spread out over 250 acres. With an investment of over $1 billion, Open is expected to be one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.</p>
<p>Athens has spared no expense in creating this new wonder. The rides have been custom-designed by some of the leading engineers in the industry, and the landscaping is nothing short of spectacular. From the towering peaks of Mount Olympus to the idyllic beaches of the Aegean Sea, Open offers something for everyone.</p>
<p>There’s already a long list of celebrities and dignitaries who have booked tickets to Open, anxious to experience its many spectacles. The park is set to open on May 1st, so there’s still time to get your tickets! Don’t miss out on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.</p>
