<p>The storm, which came through the area late Monday night, caused widespread power outages and property damage. Officials say it could take days to restore power to all areas.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the casino is trying to make do with generators, but that’s not enough to run all of the machines. So officials are having to manually open and close machines, which is causing huge lines and long wait times.</p>
<p>“It’s been a mess,” said one official. “We’ve never seen anything like this.”</p>
<p>The outage is also causing problems for hotel guests, who are without air conditioning or working elevators.</p>
<h1 id="Laughlin-Casino-Hit-Hard-by-Flintstones-Slot-Machine-Storm"><a href="#Laughlin-Casino-Hit-Hard-by-Flintstones-Slot-Machine-Storm" class="headerlink" title="Laughlin Casino Hit Hard by Flintstones Slot Machine Storm!"></a>Laughlin Casino Hit Hard by Flintstones Slot Machine Storm!</h1><p>It was just another day at the Laughlin Casino when all of the sudden, a storm of Flintstones Slot Machines descended on the casino.</p>
<p>The machines were spitting out money like there was no tomorrow, and the casino staff could do nothing but watch as players won and won.</p>
<p>In the end, the casino reported losses of over $1 million as a result of the storm, and many players walked away with huge profits.</p>
<p>It’s still not clear exactly what caused the storm of Flintstones Slot Machines, but players are certainly hoping it happens again soon!</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-Flash-Flood-Causes-Damage-at-Laughlin-Casino"><a href="#Slot-Machine-Flash-Flood-Causes-Damage-at-Laughlin-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine Flash Flood Causes Damage at Laughlin Casino!"></a>Slot Machine Flash Flood Causes Damage at Laughlin Casino!</h1><p>Heavy rains on Saturday, October 20, caused a flash flood at the Laughlin River Lodge and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada.</p>
<p>The flooding happened in the early morning hours, when 6 inches of rain fell in just two hours. The storm water swept through the casino’s lower level, causing extensive damage to gaming machines, furnishings, and equipment.</p>
<p>No one was hurt in the flooding, but the casino was forced to close its doors while crews cleaned up the mess and assessed the damage. It is not yet known how long it will take to repair the damages or how much it will cost.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that a casino has been hit by flooding. In February 2018, heavy rains caused severe flooding at The Venetian Las Vegas Resort and Casino, resulting in millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-suffers-major-losses-in-freak-Flintstones-Slot-Machine-storm"><a href="#Casino-suffers-major-losses-in-freak-Flintstones-Slot-Machine-storm" class="headerlink" title="Casino suffers major losses in freak Flintstones Slot Machine storm!"></a>Casino suffers major losses in freak Flintstones Slot Machine storm!</h1><p>In a bizarre turn of events, the local casino has suffered major losses after a freak storm hit the area and knocked out power to their Flintstones Slot Machine.</p>
<p>Staff arrived early this morning to find that the machine was completely destroyed, with all of the coins inside scattered across the floor.</p>
<p> Casino management is still trying to determine how much money was lost in the incident, but estimates suggest that it could be as much as $10,000.</p>
<p>“This is a major blow to our business,” said one spokesperson for the casino. “We’re going to have to look at ways to make up for this loss.”</p>
<p>The Flintstones Slot Machine has been a popular attraction at the casino since it was installed a few years ago, and this is the first time it has been affected by bad weather.</p>
<p>Casino officials say they are working on getting a new machine installed as soon as possible.</p>
<h1 id="Flintstones-Slot-Machine-Storm-Ravages-Laughlin-Casino"><a href="#Flintstones-Slot-Machine-Storm-Ravages-Laughlin-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Flintstones Slot Machine Storm Ravages Laughlin Casino!"></a>Flintstones Slot Machine Storm Ravages Laughlin Casino!</h1><p>A freak storm, touched down in Laughlin Nevada on Saturday October 13th causing extensive damage to the local casino. The Flintstones slot machine was apparently pushed over by the high winds, landing on several other gaming machines.</p>
<p>The storm caused a power outage which in turn led to a fire in the casino’s kitchen. The fire quickly spread through the building, completely gutting it. No one was reported injured in the incident.</p>
<p>Casino officials are still trying to assess the extent of the damage, but early estimates put losses at over $2 million dollars. It is not yet clear if insurance will cover all of the damages.</p>
