	  <h1 id="Pharaoh-casino-roulette-table-what-is-it"><a href="#Pharaoh-casino-roulette-table-what-is-it" class="headerlink" title="Pharaoh casino roulette table - what is it?"></a>Pharaoh casino roulette table - what is it?</h1><p>A Pharaoh casino roulette table is a unique type of roulette table that is found in some of the world’s top casinos. The table features an elevated playing surface, as well as two ornate pharaoh statues that serve as the table’s legs.</p>
<p>The history of the Pharaoh casino roulette table is a bit unclear, but it is believed that the table was first created in the early 1800s by a French cabinet maker named Antoine-Louis Boulle. Boulle is most famous for creating the intricate marquetry designs that are found on many pieces of antique furniture. It is speculated that Boulle may have created the Pharaoh casino roulette table as a commissioned piece for an unknown French casino.</p>
<p>The Pharaoh casino roulette table quickly became popular among high-rolling gamblers, and can still be found in some of the world’s most luxurious casinos. The elevated playing surface gives players a better view of the game, and the two ornate pharaoh statues add a touch of elegance to the proceedings.</p>
<p>While there are no official records on how much money has been won and lost on Pharaoh casino roulette tables over the years, it is safe to say that they have played a significant role in some very large gambling wins and losses.</p>

<h1 id="Where-is-it-from"><a href="#Where-is-it-from" class="headerlink" title="Where is it from?"></a>Where is it from?</h1><p>The origin of the Easter egg is not definitively known. It is widely believed to have originated in central and eastern Europe, where a number of pagan springtime celebrations were held. One possible precursor to the modern Easter egg is the “ovender” or “painted egg”, a decorated eggshell that was given as a gift in the 14th century.</p>
<p>In parts of Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary and the Czech Republic, children would search for brightly coloured eggs hidden in gardens and meadows. These eggs were often left by the Easter Bunny, who was said to leave them as gifts for good children. In some German-speaking countries, it was traditional to give eggs wrapped in linen clothes meant to represent human beings. These gifts were called “Eiermann” (egg men) and “Ostermann” (Easter man), respectively.</p>
<p>The first reports of an Easter egg hunt come from the UK in the early 1800s. In 1826, an English magazine reported on an Easter egg hunt organized by Queen Charlotte, wife of King George IV. The royal family would hide colored eggs throughout their palace gardens for their children and guests to find.</p>
<p>Today, the Easter egg hunt is a popular tradition all over the world.</p>
