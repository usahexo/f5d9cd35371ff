	  <h1 id="Where-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-New-Casino-Would-Be-Located-Is-Up-In-The-Air"><a href="#Where-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-New-Casino-Would-Be-Located-Is-Up-In-The-Air" class="headerlink" title="Where Paris Saint-Germain’s New Casino Would Be Located Is Up In The Air"></a>Where Paris Saint-Germain’s New Casino Would Be Located Is Up In The Air</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain, a major French sports team, has been planning to open a new casino in the Paris area. But disagreements over where it should be located have caused delays.</p>
<p>The club’s chairman and CEO, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, said in December that the casino would open this year. But Reuters has reported that the opening is now likely to be pushed back to 2020.</p>
<p>The reason for the delay is a disagreement between PSG and the mayor of Saint-Denis, a northern suburb of Paris. PSG wants to build the casino near its new training ground, which is also in Saint-Denis. But the mayor wants it built closer to the city center.</p>
<p>Al-Khelaifi said that he was “surprised” by the mayor’s position and that PSG had already invested 200 million euros ($229 million) in its new training ground. He said that if the casino were not built near the training ground, “the project is dead.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the mayor told Reuters that she wanted the casino to be built near the Stade de France, a stadium that hosted several matches during the 1998 World Cup. She said that it would be a “bad sign” if PSG were allowed to get around zoning restrictions simply because it is a sports team.</p>
<p>So far there has been no resolution to the disagreement. If PSG’s casino does not open this year or next year, it will miss out on what is likely to be a major expansion of the French gambling market. The country’s gambling regulator recently gave permission for new casinos to open in seven cities, including Paris.</p>
<h1 id="Mayor-Rahm-Emanuel-Eyes-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-Casino-For-Chicago"><a href="#Mayor-Rahm-Emanuel-Eyes-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-Casino-For-Chicago" class="headerlink" title="Mayor Rahm Emanuel Eyes Paris Saint-Germain’s Casino For Chicago"></a>Mayor Rahm Emanuel Eyes Paris Saint-Germain’s Casino For Chicago</h1><p>Mayor Rahm Emanuel is looking to bring a little bit of Paris Saint-Germain to Chicago by eyeing the French club’s ownership of a casino.</p>
<p>According to reports, Emanuel is interested in PSG’s 50% stake in the Casino de la Tour, which is located about an hour outside of Paris. The mayor feels that the casino would be a great addition to Chicago and would help to bring more tourism dollars into the city.</p>
<p>Emanuel has already had some success in attracting foreign investment to Chicago. In recent years, he has been able to attract companies like Airbnb and Uber to set up shop in the city. Now, he is looking to add a casino to the mix.</p>
<p>If Emanuel is successful in acquiring PSG’s casino stake, it would be another major feather in his cap. The mayor has been under fire recently due to several high-profile scandals, but this latest move could help him win back some favor with Chicago residents.</p>
<p>The Casino de la Tour is a major tourist destination, and Emanuel believes that bringing it to Chicago would be a huge boon for the city’s economy. He is currently in negotiations with PSG about purchasing their stake in the casino, and it remains to be seen whether or not a deal will be reached.</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Sands-Emerges-As-Frontrunner-To-Build-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-Casino-In-Chicago"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Sands-Emerges-As-Frontrunner-To-Build-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-Casino-In-Chicago" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Sands Emerges As Frontrunner To Build Paris Saint-Germain’s Casino In Chicago"></a>Las Vegas Sands Emerges As Frontrunner To Build Paris Saint-Germain’s Casino In Chicago</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain is planning to open a casino in Chicago, and there are several companies bidding for the project. But recent reports suggest that Las Vegas Sands has emerged as the frontrunner to win the contract.</p>
<p>If Las Vegas Sands does win the contract, it would be a major win for the company. Not only would it get to build a casino in one of America’s most vibrant cities, but it would also gain an important foothold in the European market.</p>
<p>Paris Saint-Germain is said to be looking for a company that can provide both casino and hotel services. And Las Vegas Sands is well-equipped to meet that need. It has a large portfolio of hotels and casinos around the world, including properties in Singapore, Macau, and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands has already been active in Chicago’s gaming market. In 2016, it opened a $1.5 billion casino resort in Elgin, Illinois. The new casino would be much larger than that property, however, and would likely attract many more visitors to the city.</p>
<p>In addition to its gaming operations, Las Vegas Sands is also active in other areas such as real estate development and energy production. This makes it an attractive partner for Paris Saint-Germain, which is looking for a company with a diversified business model.</p>
<p>The negotiations between Paris Saint-Germain and Las Vegas Sands are still ongoing, so there is no final agreement yet. But if things proceed as planned, we could see construction of the new casino begin early next year.</p>
<h1 id="Who-Will-Build-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-Casino-In-Chicago"><a href="#Who-Will-Build-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-Casino-In-Chicago" class="headerlink" title="Who Will Build Paris Saint-Germain’s Casino In Chicago?"></a>Who Will Build Paris Saint-Germain’s Casino In Chicago?</h1><p>The new Paris Saint-Germain casino that is being built in Chicago is a huge project that is going to take many months to complete. The casino is going to be huge, and it will be the perfect place for people in Chicago to come and enjoy themselves. There are many different aspects of this project that need to be taken care of, and it will require a lot of work from many different people.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of this project is finding someone who can build the casino. This is not an easy task, and it requires a lot of experience and knowledge. There are many different construction companies in Chicago, but not all of them are capable of handling a project as big as this one.</p>
<p>So, who will build Paris Saint-Germain’s casino in Chicago? This is a question that has been on many people’s minds lately. There are a few companies that seem like they would be the best fit for this job, but it is still too early to tell who will get the contract.</p>
<p>There are a few things that companies will need to keep in mind if they want to win the contract for the Paris Saint-Germain casino. First of all, they will need to have a lot of experience with construction projects that are similar in size and scope. They will also need to have a good track record, and they should be able to show that they are capable of completing a project on time and within budget.</p>
<p>Finally, companies will need to offer a competitive price if they want to win the contract for the Paris Saint-Germain casino. This is an important factor, and it could end up deciding who gets the job. There are many companies that would love to get their hands on this contract, so bidding wars are likely to break out.</p>
<p>So, who will build Paris Saint-Germain’s casino in Chicago? Only time will tell, but it is clear that this is going to be a very competitive process.</p>
<h1 id="Could-London-Or-Amsterdam-Be-The-Home-Of-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-New-Casino"><a href="#Could-London-Or-Amsterdam-Be-The-Home-Of-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-New-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Could London Or Amsterdam Be The Home Of Paris Saint-Germain’s New Casino?"></a>Could London Or Amsterdam Be The Home Of Paris Saint-Germain’s New Casino?</h1><p><em>Paris Saint-Germain is considering a number of locations for its new casino, but two in particular have emerged as the favorites: London and Amsterdam. Here’s why each city could be a good fit for the team.</em></p>
<p>Supporters of Paris Saint-Germain know that the club has been trying to get a casino license for a while now. The team’s president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, first revealed the plans a few years ago, but the process has been delayed by red tape. Now it appears that a decision has finally been made on where the new casino will go, with two cities in particular in the running: London and Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Both of these cities have several things going for them. For one, both are major tourist destinations, which would help to bring in customers to the casino. Additionally, both have large expat populations, which would give Paris Saint-Germain an international audience. Finally, both cities are close to Paris – meaning that supporters could easily travel there to visit the casino.</p>
<p>However, there are also some drawbacks to each location. In London, there is already a lot of competition among casinos, which could make it difficult for Paris Saint-Germain to stand out. Additionally, Brexit could have an impact on tourism to the city. Amsterdam may be more welcoming to a new casino, but it is smaller than London and may not have as much potential for growth.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s hard to say definitively which city is better suited for Paris Saint-Germain’s new casino. Both offer certain advantages and disadvantages that will need to be weighed up carefully before a final decision is made. In any case, it’s clear that Al-Khelaifi and his team are committed to expanding the club’s business interests and ensuring that its followers have plenty of opportunities to support their team off the pitch as well as on it!</p>
