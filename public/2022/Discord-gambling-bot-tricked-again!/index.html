	  <h1 id="Discord-gambling-bot-tricked-again"><a href="#Discord-gambling-bot-tricked-again" class="headerlink" title="Discord gambling bot tricked again!"></a>Discord gambling bot tricked again!</h1><p>Discord gambling bot tricked again as user managed to win a large sum of money through the use of the bot. This is not the first time that the bot has been tricked, with several other users managing to win money in a similar way.</p>
<p>The bot is designed to allow users to gamble with each other, with a variety of different games available. However, it seems that some users are finding ways to game the system in order to win more money.</p>
<p>In this instance, the user managed to win over $1,000 by betting against the bot on a game of blackjack. The user managed to get 21 on their first two cards, which beat the bot’s hand of 18.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that the Discord gambling bot has been tricked, with several other users managing to win money in a similar way. It’s likely that the developers will need to update the bot in order to prevent these kinds of exploits from happening in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Discord-gambling-bot-scammed-by-new-method"><a href="#Discord-gambling-bot-scammed-by-new-method" class="headerlink" title="Discord gambling bot scammed by new method!"></a>Discord gambling bot scammed by new method!</h1><p>Discord gambling bots are being scammed by a new method, and it’s costing the bots a lot of money.</p>
<p>The new scamming method takes advantage of the way that the bots handle losing bets. When a player loses a bet, the bot refunds them their original bet plus the amount of the bet that they lost. This is how the scam works:</p>
<p>The scammer sets up a fake account and bets a small amount of money on a color (red or black). If they lose, they immediately quit the game. The bot then refunds them their original bet plus the amount of the bet that they lost. The scammer then sets up another fake account and repeats the process.</p>
<p>Since the bot refunds both bets, including the original bet, the scammer can quickly rack up free money by repeating this process over and over again. In some cases, they have managed to scam bots out of hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>There are several ways to protect your bot from this type of scamming attack. One is to disable refunding of losing bets altogether. Alternatively, you can set a limit on how much money can be refunded in a single transaction. This will help to prevent the bot from being scammed out of large sums of money in a single go.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-fool-the-Discord-gambling-bot"><a href="#How-to-fool-the-Discord-gambling-bot" class="headerlink" title="How to fool the Discord gambling bot!"></a>How to fool the Discord gambling bot!</h1><p>Hey everyone, in this article I’m going to show you how to beat the Discord gambling bot!</p>
<p>The first step is to load up the bot’s game and see what games are available. For this example, let’s use the popular ‘flip coin’ game. In this game, you simply flip a coin and if it lands on heads, you get double your bet back; if it lands on tails, you lose your bet.</p>
<p>Now that we know how the game works, it’s time to start betting! We’re going to start by betting $1 on heads. If the coin flips and lands on heads, we’ll double our bet and put $2 on heads for the next flip. If it flips again and lands on heads, we’ll double our bet again and put $4 on heads for the next flip. And so on, until it eventually flips tails and we lose our entire bet.</p>
<p>By betting in this way, we’re guaranteed to win at least one round of the game (assuming the coin doesn’t keep flipping tails!). And since we’re only betting a small amount each time, our overall winnings will be relatively small too - perfect for beating the gambling bot!</p>
<h1 id="New-Discord-gambling-bot-method-released"><a href="#New-Discord-gambling-bot-method-released" class="headerlink" title="New Discord gambling bot method released!"></a>New Discord gambling bot method released!</h1><p>Discord gambling bots have been all the rage lately with giveaways and such, but many people are looking for a more permanent betting solution. Today we release our new Discord gambling bot method that allows you to set up your own betting server!</p>
<p>To get started, first create a new Discord server. This will be your home base for your betting server. Next, invite the bot to your new server and give it the necessary permissions. You’ll also want to create a few roles (or use the existing ones) for your players - don’t forget to assign one as the “admin” role.</p>
<p>The next step is to add some games for your players to bet on. For this example, we’ll use three games: red/black in roulette, heads/tails in coin flipping, and odd/even in dice rolling. To create a game, type the following command into the bot:</p>
<p>!addgame <game name> <minimum bet> <maximum bet> <house edge></p>
<p>For example:<br>!addgame redblack $0.01 $10 1%</p>
<p>This will create a game called “redblack” with a minimum bet of $0.01 and a maximum bet of $10. The house edge will be 1%. You can add as many games as you like - just make sure each has its own unique name and parameters.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to start betting! Each player must join the chat channel that corresponds to the game they want to play in. So for example, if you want to play red/black in roulette, join the “redblack” chat channel. Once everyone is ready, type !bet into the chat channel and hit enter. This will bring up a list of all available bets for that game. Choose your bet and hit enter again to submit your bet. The bot will automatically keep track of everyone’s bets and payouts so there’s no need for complicated math formulas or anything like that!</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it! Give our new Discord gambling bot method a try today and see how much fun you can have with your friends!</p>
<h1 id="Discord-gambling-bots-being-fooled-left-and-right"><a href="#Discord-gambling-bots-being-fooled-left-and-right" class="headerlink" title="Discord gambling bots being fooled left and right!"></a>Discord gambling bots being fooled left and right!</h1><p>Discord gambling bots are being fooled left and right! It has been happening for a while now, with the latest incident resulting in a bot losing almost $2000 worth of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The bot in question is called “DiceBot” and it allows users to gamble on dice games. The bot was recently tricked by a user who deposited 0.001 BTC (worth around $2 at the time) and then withdrew 6.5 BTC (worth over $13,000 at the time).</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Discord gambling bots have been fooled. Just a few weeks ago, another user tricked a bot called “FortniteBots” out of nearly $600 worth of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>So why are Discord gambling bots being fooled left and right? There are a few possible reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The bots are using simple algorithms that can easily be fooled by sophisticated users.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bots are not properly verifying user identities, allowing scammers to easily exploit them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bots are not properly verifying game outcomes, which allows scammers to easily win bets.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Regardless of the reason, it’s clear that Discord gambling bots need to be better protected against scams. Hopefully developers will address this issue soon so that users can feel safe betting their money on these platforms.</p>
