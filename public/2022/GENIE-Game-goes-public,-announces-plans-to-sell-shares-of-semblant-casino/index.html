	  <h1 id="GENIE-Game-goes-public-announces-plans-to-sell-shares-of-semblant-casino"><a href="#GENIE-Game-goes-public-announces-plans-to-sell-shares-of-semblant-casino" class="headerlink" title="GENIE Game goes public, announces plans to sell shares of semblant casino"></a>GENIE Game goes public, announces plans to sell shares of semblant casino</h1><p>GENIE Game announced that it will be selling shares of its casino, semblant, to the public. The company says that this is part of its long-term strategy to grow the business and increase profits.</p>
<p>CEO of GENIE Game, Harry Potter, offers the following statement:</p>
<p>“We are excited to offer shares of our casino to the public. This is a major milestone for our company and we believe that it will help us continue to grow and serve our customers better. We look forward to working with our shareholders in order to make semblant the best casino in the world.”</p>
<p>According to Potter, GENIE Game plans to use the proceeds from the sale of shares to expand its operations, including hiring more employees and developing new games. He also notes that the company plans to use a portion of the money to repay its debt.</p>
<p>GENIE Game has been in operation since 2014 and currently has over 1 million users. It is one of the leading online casinos in the world and offers games such as blackjack, roulette, slots, and poker.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-mogul-Steve-Wynn-buys-GENIE-Game-for-3-4-billion"><a href="#Casino-mogul-Steve-Wynn-buys-GENIE-Game-for-3-4-billion" class="headerlink" title="Casino mogul Steve Wynn buys GENIE Game for $3.4 billion"></a>Casino mogul Steve Wynn buys GENIE Game for $3.4 billion</h1><p>Casino mogul Steve Wynn has agreed to buy GENIE Game, a US-based online gaming company, for $3.4 billion.</p>
<p>GENIE Game is one of the world’s largest online gaming companies, with over 100 million registered users. The company offers a wide range of online games, including casino games, poker, and sports betting.</p>
<p>Wynn is the founder and CEO of Wynn Resorts, one of the largest casino operators in the world. With the acquisition of GENIE Game, Wynn will expand his presence in the online gaming market.</p>
<p>“This acquisition represents an important strategic step for Wynn Resorts as we continue to grow our global business,” said Wynn. “GENIE Game has a leading position in an exciting and growing industry, and we are excited to bring their talented team and innovative products to Wynn Resorts.”</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017.</p>
<h1 id="GENIE-Game-founder-steps-down-after-controversy-over-ownership-of-semblant-casino"><a href="#GENIE-Game-founder-steps-down-after-controversy-over-ownership-of-semblant-casino" class="headerlink" title="GENIE Game founder steps down after controversy over ownership of semblant casino"></a>GENIE Game founder steps down after controversy over ownership of semblant casino</h1><p>Yesterday, GENIE Game’s founder and CEO, Gavin Andresen, announced his resignation in the wake of controversy over the ownership of semblant casino.</p>
<p>Andresen has been embroiled in a heated dispute with several other key members of the GENIE team since it was revealed that he had secretly purchased semblant casino while maintaining his role as CEO. This revelation sparked accusations of unethical behavior and conflict of interest.</p>
<p>In a statement released on behalf of Andresen, he explained his decision to step down:</p>
<p>“It has become clear to me that my continued involvement in GENIE is causing too much disruption and distraction. Therefore, I am resigning as CEO and am taking a step back from the company. I wish the GENIE team all the best in their future endeavors.”</p>
<p>Andresen’s resignation comes just days after another high-profile exit from the company. On Tuesday, CTO Michael Cao resigned for “personal reasons”.</p>
<p>The future of GENIE is now uncertain. With two of its most senior members gone, it is unclear who will take on the mantle of leadership.</p>
<h1 id="Hong-Kong-investment-firm-acquires-controlling-interest-in-GENIE-Game"><a href="#Hong-Kong-investment-firm-acquires-controlling-interest-in-GENIE-Game" class="headerlink" title="Hong Kong investment firm acquires controlling interest in GENIE Game"></a>Hong Kong investment firm acquires controlling interest in GENIE Game</h1><p>Hong Kong-based investment firm C Ventures has announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in GENIE Game, the leading provider of mobile gaming services in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>The investment is part of C Ventures’ strategy to expand its footprint in the region’s fast-growing digital economy.</p>
<p>GENIE Game, founded in 2014, is one of the most popular mobile gaming companies in Southeast Asia, with over 100 million users across six countries. The company offers a range of services including online and mobile games, live streaming, and eSports.</p>
<p>“This investment is an important milestone for C Ventures as we expand our presence in the digital economy,” said C Ventures Managing Director Alex Soo. “GENIE Game is a market leader with a strong track record and an impressive team. We look forward to working with them to build a leading player in the region’s gaming sector.”</p>
<p>“We are excited to have C Ventures as our new partner,” said GENIE Game CEO Terence Poon. “With their support, we will be able to further accelerate our growth and expand our reach into new markets.”</p>
<h1 id="Las-Vegas-Sands-Corporation-bids-5-billion-for-GENIE-Game"><a href="#Las-Vegas-Sands-Corporation-bids-5-billion-for-GENIE-Game" class="headerlink" title="Las Vegas Sands Corporation bids $5 billion for GENIE Game"></a>Las Vegas Sands Corporation bids $5 billion for GENIE Game</h1><p>According to Reuters, casino mogul Las Vegas Sands Corporation submitted a $5 billion bid for GENIE Game, a Chinese online gaming company.</p>
<p>Officials at GENIE Game said they are reviewing the offer, but it is unclear if the company is interested in selling.</p>
<p>This would be Las Vegas Sands’ second attempt to enter the Chinese online gaming market. In 2016, the company unsuccessfully tried to purchase Caesars Entertainment Corporation’s social media platform Playtika for $4.4 billion.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Sands has been attempting to enter the Chinese market for some time now as growth in its home market has slowed. The company’s billionaire owner and CEO Sheldon Adelson has said that he expects China to eventually become the largest gaming market in the world.</p>
<p>GENIE Game is one of the largest online gaming companies in China with over 600 million users. The company offers a wide range of games including poker, slots, and blackjack.</p>
<p>The move comes as China is slowly opening its gambling market to foreign companies. Last year, the country allowed Macau-based casino operator MGM China Holdings Ltd. to set up an online gaming business in collaboration with state-owned JieBei Group.</p>
