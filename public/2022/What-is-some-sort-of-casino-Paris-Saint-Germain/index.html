The term usually refers to a brick and mortar gambling hall, but may also describe an online casino. Gambling has been legal in France since 1836, and there are now around 220 casinos in the country.</p>
<h1 id="History-of-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#History-of-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="History of casino Paris Saint-Germain"></a>History of casino Paris Saint-Germain</h1><p>The first casino in Paris Saint-Germain was opened in 1895 by Aristide Boucicaut, the founder of the Bon Marché department store. Boucicaut’s casino was quite small, with just 12 gaming tables. It closed down in 1907 following a police raid.</p>
<p>The modern casino paris saint-germain as we know it was founded invia a partnership between François André and Lucien Barrière. The new casino was inaugurated on 14 October 1967, and featured a gaming room with 110 slot machines and 30 gaming tables. It also had a restaurant, bar, and nightclub.</p>
<p>The original Casino de Paris was destroyed by fire in 1977, but was rebuilt and reopened two years later. In 2004, the Casino de Paris merged with the Forges les Eaux casino to form the Groupe Lucien Barrière. This group currently operates 23 casinos in France.</p>
<h1 id="What-games-can-be-played-at-a-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#What-games-can-be-played-at-a-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="What games can be played at a casino Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>What games can be played at a casino Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>Casinos in France offer a wide range of games including blackjack, roulette, baccarat, poker, and craps. They also offer several types of slot machines, including traditional one-armed bandits and more modern video slots. Some casinos also have electronic table games such as roulette and blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-dress-code-at-a-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#What-is-the-dress-code-at-a-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="What is the dress code at a casino Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>What is the dress code at a casino Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>While there is no official dress code at French casinos, most people dress relatively smartly. A jacket and tie is generally considered to be appropriate attire for men, while women may wear dresses or skirts equivalent to smart casual clothing. Entry may be refused if you are wearing tracksuits or other casual clothing.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-some-sort-of-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#Where-is-some-sort-of-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="Where is some sort of casino Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>Where is some sort of casino Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>The Parc des Princes could be the home of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. as well as the national rugby team, France XV. The stadium, which is located in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, has a current capacity of 48,712 seats after being renovated for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. However, a larger and more modern football stadium is planned within the Parisian city limits and should be ready for the 2020/21 season.</p>
<p>The original idea was to demolish the Parc des Princes and build a new 65,000-seat stadium in its place, but due to public outcry and protests from nearby residents, that plan was scrapped. The new project will now see PSG move to a new venue called Jean Bouin Stadium—named after the French rugby player who died in World War I—which will have a capacity of around 40,000 spectators.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news for fans of Les Rouge-et-Bleu though, as renovations on the Parc des Princes are set to begin in 2019 and should be completed by 2022. These upgrades will include a brand-new roof, improved seating and facilities, and a brand-new pitch. So even though PSG might not be calling the Parc des Princes home for much longer, at least it will still be standing!</p>
<p>If you want to catch a game at Paris Saint-Germain F.C.—or any other major sport event for that matter—the closest casino would likely be at Casino de Deauville or Casino Barrière de Deauville which are both around an hour away from the capital city.</p>

<h1 id="Who-are-some-sort-of-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-main-owners"><a href="#Who-are-some-sort-of-casino-Paris-Saint-Germain’s-main-owners" class="headerlink" title="Who are some sort of casino Paris Saint-Germain’s main owners?"></a>Who are some sort of casino Paris Saint-Germain’s main owners?</h1><p>The Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) is Paris Saint-Germain’s main owner. It is a state-owned investment company based in Qatar. The QSI acquired a controlling stake in the club in May 2011.</p>
<p>On 17 August 2017, it was announced that the Qatar Investment Authority had agreed to sell a minority stake of 49% to American businessman Jay-Z and his company Roc Nation. As part of the deal, Jay-Z will become a global ambassador for the club and advise on sports and business matters. </p>
<p>Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is also reported to be an investor in PSG, along with other businessmen from Qatar.</p>
