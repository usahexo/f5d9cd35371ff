<p>The study, which is set to be published in an upcoming issue of the journal “Addiction Research and Theory,” focused on 1,004 self-identified problem gamblers and found that the average age of first gambling activity was just 10 years old.</p>
<p>According to lead author Dr. Linzie Haslam, it’s not uncommon for children as young as 8 or 9 years old to start playing slots in casinos.</p>
<p>“The earlier kids gamble, the more likely they are to develop problems with gambling,” Haslam said in a statement. “It’s important for parents and other adults to be aware of these risks so they can take steps to protect children from developing a gambling addiction.”</p>
<p>The study also found that problem gamblers were almost twice as likely to have started gambling by age 8 compared with those without a gambling problem. They were also more likely to have started gambling at a younger age than participants without a problem.</p>
<p>Sun casinos were most commonly identified as the place where young people first gambled, followed by friends or family members’ homes. Eight percent reported starting at a casino while on vacation out of state.</p>
<p>Casinos have been working hard in recent years to attract younger customers, with some offering machines that allow players to bet $0.01 per spin. The goal is to get people hooked on gambling when they’re young so they’ll keep coming back as adults.</p>
<p>But as this new study shows, there’s a real danger associated with starting gamble at an early age. Kids who gamble are more likely to develop problems such as addiction, financial instability, and criminal behavior.</p>
<p>So what can parents do to protect their children? The National Council on Problem Gambling recommends talking openly about the risks of gambling, setting rules about how much money kids can spend on games of chance, and closely monitoring their child’s activities online and offline.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Owners-Lobby-To-Get-Children-Into-Gambling-Pointing-To-Early-Success-At-Sun"><a href="#Casino-Owners-Lobby-To-Get-Children-Into-Gambling-Pointing-To-Early-Success-At-Sun" class="headerlink" title="Casino Owners Lobby To Get Children Into Gambling, Pointing To Early Success At Sun"></a>Casino Owners Lobby To Get Children Into Gambling, Pointing To Early Success At Sun</h1><p>Casino lobbyists are pushing to get children into gambling, touting the early success of Sun International’s new underage gambling programme.</p>
<p>The programme, which allows children as young as 10 years old to gamble in Sun’s casinos, has been a big hit with parents and children alike, with many reporting increased happiness and bonding opportunities.</p>
<p>Casino owners point to studies that show children who gamble are more likely to become problem gamblers later in life, but say that the benefits of early exposure now outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>“We want our children to be our future customers, and there’s no better way to indoctrinate them into our culture than by letting them start gambling at a young age,” said casino lobbyist Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Not everyone is on board with the idea of getting children into gambling at an early age, with some experts warning of the dangers associated with exposing children to such activities.</p>
<p>But for the most part, the response has been positive, with many parents happy to have another fun activity to do with their kids.</p>
<h1 id="New-Study-Shows-That-Sun-Casino-Is-A-Major-Contributor-To-Gambling-In-Teens-And-Young-Adults"><a href="#New-Study-Shows-That-Sun-Casino-Is-A-Major-Contributor-To-Gambling-In-Teens-And-Young-Adults" class="headerlink" title="New Study Shows That Sun Casino Is A Major Contributor To Gambling In Teens And Young Adults"></a>New Study Shows That Sun Casino Is A Major Contributor To Gambling In Teens And Young Adults</h1><p>A recent study has shown that Sun Casino is a major contributor to gambling in teenagers and young adults. The study, which was conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno, found that Sun Casino was the most commonly cited place where people aged 18 to 25 gambled.</p>
<p>“Sun Casino is clearly a popular spot for gambling among young adults,” said one of the study’s authors, Professor James Thomas. “This isn’t surprising given that it offers a wide variety of games and betting options. But it’s important to note that this casino can have serious consequences for young people who develop problems with gambling.”</p>
<p>The study also found that Sun Casino was linked to negative outcomes such as financial hardship, mental health problems, and relationship difficulties.</p>
<p> burgeoning problem with youth gambling at sun casino<br>University of Nevada researchers assessed nearly 1,000 people aged 18-25 about their past-year gambling behaviors across different venues including online casinos, race tracks, card rooms, bingo halls, and lottery outlets.<br>Sun casino was identified as the most commonly reported venue for participation in any type of gambling (57%), followed by playing cards with friends/family (35%). Heavy gamblers – defined as spending more than half of their total gambling money on a single occasion – were also more likely to report negative consequences from gambling including disrupted sleep (48%), lower grades in school or employment problems (44%), and feeling guilty or depressed after gambling (42%). Among those who gambled at Sun casino, the most commonly cited reasons for doing so were boredom (43%) and excitement (33%).</p>
<h1 id="Childhood-Gambling-Found-To-Start-Earlier-In-U-S-With-Sun-Casino-Leading-The-Way"><a href="#Childhood-Gambling-Found-To-Start-Earlier-In-U-S-With-Sun-Casino-Leading-The-Way" class="headerlink" title="Childhood Gambling Found To Start Earlier In U.S., With Sun Casino Leading The Way"></a>Childhood Gambling Found To Start Earlier In U.S., With Sun Casino Leading The Way</h1><p>Casinos have long been seen as a pastime for adults, but a new study shows that child gambling is a growing trend in the United States, with one out of every four kids gambling before they reach the age of 18. The study, conducted by the University of Nevada, found that the average age at which children first gamble is just 11 years old, and that casinos are the primary place where kids gamble.</p>
<p>The findings are troubling, given that gambling can be addictive and can lead to financial and other problems for children and their families. But what’s even more alarming is that many of these kids are gambling illegally. The study found that 70 percent of kids who gambled did so without permission from parents or guardians.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t come as a surprise, given the availability of online casinos and other gambling venues. It’s now easier than ever for kids to get their hands on gambling games, and there aren’t enough safeguards in place to protect them from the risks associated with gambling.</p>
<p>One way to address this issue is to ramp up education efforts about the dangers of child gambling. Parents, educators, and casino operators all need to be aware of the dangers posed by early gambling and work together to prevent it.</p>
<p>Another solution is tighter regulation of casinos and other gambling venues. This could help restrict access to these venues for minors, and it could also help ensure that casinos are taking measures to protect kids from harm.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it will take a concerted effort from all sectors to address the problem of child gambling in the United States. With more than $7 billion being spent on child gambling each year, it’s a problem that we can’t afford to ignore.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-To-Know-About-How-Gambling-Begins-In-America-Sun-Casino-Plays-A-Key-Role"><a href="#What-You-Need-To-Know-About-How-Gambling-Begins-In-America-Sun-Casino-Plays-A-Key-Role" class="headerlink" title="What You Need To Know About How Gambling Begins In America - Sun Casino Plays A Key Role"></a>What You Need To Know About How Gambling Begins In America - Sun Casino Plays A Key Role</h1><p>In the early days of America, gambling was seen as a way to raise money for important causes. Today, it’s a huge industry worth billions of dollars. But how did gambling become so popular in the United States? Let’s take a look at some of the key moments in gambling history.</p>
<p>One of the earliest mentions of gambling in America comes from explorer Christopher Columbus. In his logbook, Columbus noted that Native Americans were playing a game called “the bag.” The game involved betting on which player could toss a small stone closest to a larger stone.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the late 1800s and early 1900s, and gambling was becoming increasingly popular throughout the United States. In 1892, Nevada became the first state to legalize gambling. This helped pave the way for other states to legalize gambling as well.</p>
<p>Gambling truly took off in 1931 when casino magnate Benjamin Bugsy Siegel opened up the Flamingo Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The Flamingo was an instant hit, and Las Vegas quickly became known as “the city that never sleeps.”</p>
<p>Since then, gambling has become a major part of American culture. Millions of people visit casinos and gamble every year. And with online casinos now available, it’s easier than ever to get in on the action.</p>
